# Massive Decks

Massive Decks is a clone of the excellent [Cards against Humanity][CaH] using the [CardCast][CC] APIs (try their app if you have a ChromeCast!) and is inspired by [Pretend You're Xyzzy][PYX] (where you should go if you want to play with people you don't know).

You can try a version running at http://arcane-sea-2588.herokuapp.com/

This is an open source game developed in [Elm][elm] for the client and [Scala][scala] for the server. We also use [the Play framework][play], [less][less], and [Font Awesome][fontawesome]. Bug reports and contributions are welcome on our [GitHub repository][github].
